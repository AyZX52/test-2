                    It is my greatest delight to welcome you to this new, soul-lifting and life changing website.<br><br> While appreciating the painstaking care and patience our numerous members <br>and friends of the Celestial Church Of GOD in Nigeria and Overseas.<br> The management has seen the need and deemed it fit to design it to meet the modern day challenges of gospel propagation, having realized that the evolution of Information and Communications Technology is a modern tool to actualize the great commission of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>                  
                    Efforts have been made to preserve the heritage of Celestial Church Of God by unearthing the profiles of the church patriarchs through the introductory page called About Us. Also, our numerous website visitors have the privilege of reaching the Church Authority with their comments through our Contact Us page. Be richly blessed as you join me to continue surfing this website from time to time in Jesusâ€™ name.
